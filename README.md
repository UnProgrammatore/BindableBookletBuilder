# BindableBookletBuilder
This very simple script reads all the PDF files in a folder and merges it into a PDF that's designed to be printed for binding.
It can also add margins to the pages.

This was built in very little time for a non-developer friend of mine who needed exactly this, so it prints out instructions in italian and reads parameters from standard input instead of using command line parameters because that's easier to use for people who are not used to the command line.
